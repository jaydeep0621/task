- Skills Tested: Docker, Docker Compose, container networking, database seeding in a container, environment variable management.
- Requirements:
  - Write a 'Dockerfile' for the 'frontend' service.
  - Write a 'Dockerfile' for the 'backend' service.
  - Create a 'docker-compose.yml' at the root to define and link the 'frontend', 'backend', and 'postgres' services.
  - The 'postgres' service must be automatically seeded with the data from the 'seed_db/' directory on its first run.
  - The entire application should be launchable with 'docker-compose up'.
```
